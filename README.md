# AI In Public

In order to ramp up in my practical and theoretical foundation in AI, I am adding a tracker to track my progress in learning. The focus will be on LLMs. 

# Objective
1. Be able to explain in both high and low-level how an LLM works
2. Be able to explain the latest innovations in LLMs training and inference and what those changes brought
3. Be able to implement a basic LLM from scratch
4. Be able to deconstruct an open-source LLM model to it's components and build it back up
5. Master PyTorch first (due to available resources) then master Jax and T5X
